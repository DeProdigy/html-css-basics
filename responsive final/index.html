      <h2>Media Queries</h2>
      <p>
        A media query consists of a media type and at least one expression that limits the style sheets' scope by using media features, such as width, height, and color. Media queries, added in CSS3, let the presentation of content be tailored to a specific range of output devices without having to change the content itself.

      <h2>The Old Days</h2>
      <p>
        In the old days, websites would come in multiple variants. www.example.com, m.example.com, and wap.example.com might have all co-existed, but not well. Or a website owner just didn't care about mobile. Don't Repeat Yourself vs. The Best Experience Possible. Developers had to choose.
